      <p className="about-intro">
        CampusKart isnâ€™t just a marketplace â€“ itâ€™s your <strong>college survival kit</strong>!  
        Imagine a place where you can buy or sell lab coats, drafter kits, calculators, books, 
        and even second-hand electronics, all under one roof. Thatâ€™s CampusKart.  
        <br /><br />
        Whether youâ€™re a fresher trying to find your first lab coat or a final-year student selling 
        your old drafter, CampusKart helps you save money and pass the legacy on.  
        <br /><br />
        Why spend extra on items youâ€™ll use for only a few semesters when you can get them 
        at half the cost â€“ in great condition? At the same time, selling your old stuff means 
        youâ€™re helping juniors, making extra cash, and promoting sustainability ðŸŒ±.  
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Think of CampusKart as the OLX for students â€“ but more fun, colorful, and campus-focused!</strong>
